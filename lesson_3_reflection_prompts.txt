When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I have to work in different computer or working with others.Or I want to publish my code to everone eles.


Why might you always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I can choose what I want to pull.


Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches.When would you use one instead of another?

Forks is copy others code online. 
Clones is copy the code on web to your computer.The code can be yours or others.
Branches is different direction of the code.
When refers to other's code, I will use forks.When I need the code storeged in my computer I will use clones.When code goes to direction or working with others, I will use branches.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I have to work in different computer or working with others.Or I want to publish my code to everone eles.


Why might you always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I can choose what I want to pull.


Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches.When would you use one instead of another?

Forks is copy others code online. 
Clones is copy the code on web to your computer.The code can be yours or others.
Branches is different direction of the code.
When refers to other's code, I will use forks.When I need the code storeged in my computer I will use clones.When code goes to direction or working with others, I will use branches.


What is the benifit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It will help you to see you offline effort compared with the online effort.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I will use email or other tool to comunicate with others. That will be hard to tell the difference or collaborate. Meet will be hard.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Add different feature in the same time or bug fix.
If you only have master branch, it is easy for you to focus on code.But you can't add some other thoughts.
If you have other branches besides master you may feel hard to combine them. But you can do things in the same time.

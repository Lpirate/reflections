When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I have to work in different computer or working with others.Or I want to publish my code to everone eles.


Why might you always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I can choose what I want to pull.
